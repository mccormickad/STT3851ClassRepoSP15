	abstract = {The consequences of high sexual risk-taking behavior can be negative and lifelong and evaluating sexual risk-taking in adolescents as the problem (rather than sexual initiation as the problem) is a relatively new research orientation especially in the Nigeria context. Based on this, this study was set out to investigate the influence of self esteem, parental monitoring and parenting styles on adolescents' risky sexual behavior in Ibadan. Cross-sectional research design was used. A total number of 194 adolescents selected from three secondary schools participated in the study. Questionnaires were administered to randomly sampled adolescents that comprised of scale to measure self esteem, parental monitoring and parenting styles. Six hypotheses were tested in the study using independent sample t-test and regression analysis. The result indicated that low self esteem significantly reported higher risky sexual behavior than the those with high self esteem [t(192)=7.01, p{\textless}.001]. Additionally, adolescents with low parental monitoring significantly reported higher risky sexual behavior than the those with high parental monitoring [t(192)=2.86, p{\textless}.001]. Furthermore, the result show that adolescents with low authoritative parenting style significantly reported higher risky sexual behavior than those with high authoritative parenting style [t(192)=4.99, p{\textless}.001]; authoritarian parenting style has no significant effect on adolescents' risky sexual behavior [t(192)=-0.856, p{\textgreater}.05]; while adolescents with high permissive parenting style significantly reported higher risky sexual behavior than those with low permissive parenting style [t(192)=-4.65, p{\textless}.001]. The result further indicated that self esteem, parental monitoring and parenting styles jointly predicted adolescents' risky sexual behavior [F(3,189)=18.54; R²=0.24; p{\textless}0.001]. There was no gender effect on adolescents' risky sexual behavior [t(192)=0.311, p{\textgreater}.05]. Finally, adolescents from polygamous home significantly reported higher risky sexual behavior than those from monogamous [t(192)=-3.61, p{\textless}.001]. Based on the findings, it was concluded that self esteem, parental monitoring and parenting styles were predictors of adolescents' risky sexual behavior. Therefore it was recommended that therapists have both prevention and intervention opportunities to educate young clients about the problems associated with sexual risk-taking behaviors. Also parents could benefit from knowledge of the differences between males and females related to the effectiveness of parenting processes.},

	abstract = {Maternal and paternal psychological control, peer attitudes, and the interaction of psychological control and peer attitudes at age 13 were examined as predictors of risky sexual behavior before age 16 in a community sample of 181 youth followed from age 13 to 16. Maternal psychological control moderated the link between peer attitudes and sexual behavior. Peer acceptance of early sex predicted greater risky sexual behaviors, but only for teens whose mothers engaged in high levels of psychological control. Paternal psychological control demonstrated the same moderating effect for girls; for boys, however, high levels of paternal control predicted risky sex regardless of peer attitudes. Results are consistent with the theory that peer influences do not replace parental influences with regard to adolescent sexual behavior; rather, parental practices continue to serve an important role either directly forecasting sexual behavior or moderating the link between peer attitudes and sexual behavior.},

	abstract = {This article examines the sociocognitive processes contributing to intention to use contraception and willingness to engage in unsafe sex, using extended versions of the theory of planned behavior ({TPB}) and the Prototype/Willingness model (Gibbons \& Gerrard, 1995, 1997). Data were obtained from a questionnaire delivered to all the pupils in ninth grade (N = 196) at three schools in Oslo. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to predict intention and willingness. The results showed that subjective norm was the most important predictor of intentions for girls, whereas moral norm was most important for boys' intentions and willingness. Prototypes were the most important predictor for girls' willingness. Implications of the findings are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2012 {APA}, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},
