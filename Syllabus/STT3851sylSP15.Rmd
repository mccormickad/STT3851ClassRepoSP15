**Course Description:**  

This course covers data management, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics including testing one and two sample procedures, ANOVA, Chi-Square tests, simple regression, and multiple regression.  All of the topics will be addressed through a student selected research question that will be answered using one of four large data sets.  The course will also examine the variance-bias tradeoff, linear regression with *K-* nearest neighbors, classification including logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis, cross-validation, bootstrapping, subset selection, and choosing optimal models.

**Course Objectives:**

1.  Teach students to use a reproducible research work flow.
2.  Improve the technology expertise of all students.
3.  Students will learn to work with large data sets.
4.  Students will learn to apply statistical learning techniques.


**Course Text:**

The course will rely on two texts [_An Introdution to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Fourth%20Printing.pdf) and [_Passion Driven Statistics_](https://github.com/STT2810-SP15/STT2810ClassRepoSP15/blob/master/Book/PDS-SPRING2015alanASU.pdf?raw=true).  Students may find the excellent 
text [_Reproducible Research with R and RStudio_](http://christophergandrud.github.io/RepResR-RStudio/) by Christopher Gandrud helpful.

**Course Grading:**

There will be roughly 15 graded assignments (one per week). 15% of the course grade will be for a research proposal. Eleven of the graded assignments will be peer evaluated via http://www.crowdgrader.org.  Your grade for a peer evaluated assignment will be a combination of peer evaluations and an evaluation of your peer grading.  Grading rubrics and directions for each assignment will be provided on the course repository.  Peer evaluations will account for 50% of the course grade.  15% of the course grade will be for a poster each student will create and present during the final exam period of the course.  The remaining 20% of the course will be for participation.  Details for how to maximize participation points are provided on the course repository.  

**University Policies**

This course conforms with all Appalachian State University policies with respect to academic integrity, disability services, and class attendance.  The details of the policies may be found at
http://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi.

**Typical Class Period**

The first 30% of class will generally be lecture oriented where I will present material to supplement the reading and video assignments.  To maximize your understanding of the lecture portion of class, please read the material assigned and watch the videos assigned before coming to class.  The next 60% of the class students will work on their individual projects. The last 10% of class will generally be a review of the material covered that day and a preview of the next class.  

**Computers and Software**

If you have a reasonably new laptop, I highly recommend you bring it to class for your personal use instead of using the lab computers.  Students will need to install several programs on their personal computer to complete course assignments including [R](http://cran.r-project.org), [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), [zotero](https://www.zotero.org), and optionally [$LaTeX$](http://www.ctan.org/starter).


**How To Get Unstuck**

Consider creating an issue on the [DiscussionSTT3851](https://github.com/STT3851-SP15/DiscussionSTT3851/issues) repository if you have a question before posting to external forums.  Your classmates may have the same question or may answer your question before I can provide an answer.  Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Read 
[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen.
